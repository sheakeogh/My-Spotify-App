This project is Maven Spring Boot and React projec which leverages Spotify API's to get a users profile information.

The goal of this project is to build a unique application to form analytics for a user.


# How to Run

**Backend**

Navigate to shea-spotify-api, do this by
<code>cd shea-spotify-api</code>

Next you need to clean install the Maven project, this can be done by
<code>mvn clean install</code>

Once this is done, it is time to launch the Spring Boot. Do this by
<code>spring-boot:run</code>

**Frontend**

Once the backend server is running it is time to build the React. Similar to the backend, first we must install npm. Do this like so
<code>npm install</code>

Now that this is complete, start the project. This can be done by the following,
<code>npm start</code>
